Welcome to the Python Template created via a cookiecutter recipe. The project template is designed for a development via a `Double Loop approach` (BDD-TDD) using pytest and several other pytest libs.

## Description

The rgb function is incomplete. Complete it so that passing in RGB decimal values will result in a hexadecimal representation being returned. Valid decimal values for RGB are 0 - 255. Any values that fall out of that range must be rounded to the closest valid value.

Note: Your answer should always be 6 characters long, the shorthand with 3 will not work here.

Examples (input --> output):

```
255, 255, 255 --> "FFFFFF"
255, 255, 300 --> "FFFFFF"
0, 0, 0       --> "000000"
148, 0, 211   --> "9400D3"
```
